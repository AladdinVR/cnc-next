## The 70's

We find this event until 1972. The rewards for the winners were at the time: a letter of congratulations from the Mayor to each holder of the best time by category and a **breloque** (Medal).

The two years that followed 1971-1972 saw a growing number of swimmers, which it would be difficult to name here. We were already in the early stages of a large club and due to the popularity of swimming, the first swimming club was formed in the summer of 1973.
To set up the club, an association under the law of 1901 had to be created. Due to the lack of volunteers, the leaders of the time turned to the Céret Sportif. Indeed, the Céret Sportif was an omnisport club: its members played rugby during the winter and athletics during the summer.
Quite naturally the Céret Sportif swimming section was born.
The two lifeguards who initiated the club were: Claire Waffeleart and Jean Noël Brutus.

The first president of the Céret Sportif swimming section was Mr. Jean OMS, secretary general of the Céret town hall and father of two very good swimmers, Martine and Odile.

In 1973 the meetings with the clubs of the department began and it was often about thirty children who came. At that time the clubs were: ST CYPRIEN, ELNE, THUIR.
The club was even exported beyond the borders to the boat pool of EMPURIES.
In addition to the meetings in sports pools, there were also the crossings of bay or port: Canet, Collioure,

Within a few years the club was already very popular in the department. The activities of the club continued for three years.

In the second half of the seventies the club had its first interruption, very quickly resumed the following year with the return of Claire to the pool of Céret.

## The 1980s

The 1980s saw the development of summer clubs in Roussillon, the organisation of meetings between clubs, the first Roussillon summer club championship and the Languedoc-Roussillon regional summer club championship. The club is no longer the Céret Sportif swimming section but the Centre Nautique Cérétan.

Like any association, the club is running out of steam, many members but very few real swimmers. But it is already the beginning of the first exchanges with Spain.
Friendly meetings with Caldes de Malavella and especially the "12 hours of swimming" at night which were tests of strength: moral and physical.

The departmental meetings continued their routine, but it soon became clear that summer swimming had no future in the department. The club started to operate as a "leisure" club towards the end of the 1980s, while organising "12 hours of swimming" at the Céret swimming pool made in southern Catalonia. It also launched the organisation of "Open Days" with games for all and the first exchanges with the club of Cerbère for Water Polo.
The club changes its name once again and becomes what it is today: Le Cercle des Nageurs Cérétans.

## The 90s

At the end of the 80's and beginning of the 90's, the club took a total turn in its functioning.
Indeed, having been faced with a wall for many years in terms of equipment (open pool and no possibility of having a covered pool within thirty kilometres), the leaders of the time decided to make the club live during the winter.
To do this, they had to look for an indoor pool to rent water lines. It is thanks to the contact made with our Catalan friends from the south that the club will go to train in Figueres on Sunday mornings for nearly ten years.
The C.N.C. even went so far as to join the Catalan Swimming Federation, which recognised the existence of summer swimming and structured its championship in two parts: Challenge David Moner for the under 14s and the Pyrenees Cup for the over 14s.
The competitions took place on Thursdays and Saturdays.

Looking at the number of clubs and the large number of participants, I think they have found the secret where summer swimming is not taken as an extra burden by the federation but as a discipline in its own right and sometimes provides good swimmers for the winter clubs.

The fact is that we spent 5 years with the Catalan Federation and our stay allowed us to progress.

It was during this period that the foundations of a real swimming club in Céret were laid. We trained once a week in winter, we did 3 successive swimming training sessions for a family outing (hiking, mountain biking, skiing, orienteering, treasure hunting.....).
While keeping the conviviality that characterizes summer swimming, we learned the rigor, the organization of competitions.

When we left the French federation, we were the second largest summer club in the department. Five years later we were well ahead of the summer clubs in the department, but above all, since then, we are the first club in the region.

The meetings were held in Southern Catalonia with the clubs of : Castelfollit de La Roca, St Joan les Fonts, Bésalu, Saria, Flaça, La Jonquera, Cassa de la Selva, Caldes and Céret.

For the record, before going to swim with the Catalan Federation there were 7 summer clubs in the department: Thuir, Prades, Ille sur Têt, St Paul de Fenouillet, Cerbère and Céret. When we came back to the French Swimming Federation in the second half of the 90's, the surprise was great: there are only 3 summer clubs left in the department: Amélie, Thuir and Céret, two of which were extremely sick.
All this under the benevolent gaze of our departmental committee, which I suspect does not know that in 2003 the Cercle des Nageurs Cérétans celebrates its 30 YEARS!!!

## The 2000s

## The 2010s

The Céret club is now a reference in the world of summer swimming. At the regional level the club accumulates the first places in the regional championships. The good mood and the family spirit that reign there make swimmers come back every year. The songs of the supporters resound on the banks of the pools. At the national level, the club succeeds each year in qualifying a dozen of its youngsters between 13 and 16 years old for the French summer swimming championships, to represent the Languedoc-Roussillon region (and now Occitanie...).

All this is thanks to the family spirit that develops in the club thanks to the many activities organised throughout the summer. Training sessions, courses, the Salines hike, the family relay, the organisation of the Céret feria. So many traditions that allow the different members of the club, parents as well as children, to get together.
