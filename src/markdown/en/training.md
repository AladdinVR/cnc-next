# Details about the exercises: 
If you can't do "classic" push-ups, it's better to raise your hands than to do knee push-ups. This will allow you to maintain a good posture and work on your core at the same time. You can refer to <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gvm5Q29UHbk">this video</a>  to see the movement. 

If you are unsure of your position **feel free to film yourself to check that you are making the right move!**

* For the ankle touch, keep your torso elevated and move your feet far enough forward to make the exercise hard!

* For mountain climbers with push-ups: Start from a push-up position, then bring the left knee closer to the left elbow on the way down. Do the same on the right.
