The club is first and foremost a great place to spend a sporting summer and a very rewarding one! Whether it is physically, mentally or relationally speaking! The only things you will need are (beware the list is very long) :

- A swimming costume
- A swimming cap
- Swimming goggles
- A water bottle (filled of course)
- A big smile
- Motivation

And that's it! With time it will be possible to buy a little more material like a pull or pads.

Concerning the timetable, it depends on the time of the year and your level:

- In June (every Monday for competition group only, Tuesday and Friday):
  - from 5.30 pm to 6.30 pm for the leisure group
  - from 6.30 pm to 8 pm for the competition group
- In July (since the beginning of holidays) and August (at lesast every Monday, Tuesday, Thursday, Friday). This timetable will be apdated soon:
  - from 6.30 pm to 7.30 pm for the leisure group
  - from 7pm to 8.30pm for the competition group

The two groups above allow the different swimmers to progress at their own pace, this does not prevent the children in the leisure group from competing with the others, quite the contrary!

Registration fees are :

- 120 euros for one child
- 220 euros for two children
- 300 euros for three children
